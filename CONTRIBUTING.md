# Contributing to StealthFlow

We love your input! We want to make contributing to StealthFlow as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Our Development Process

We use GitHub to sync code and track issues.

1. **Fork the repo** and create your branch from `main`.
2. **If you've added code** that should be tested, add tests.
3. **If you've changed APIs**, update the documentation.
4. **Ensure the test suite passes**.
5. **Make sure your code lints**.
6. **Issue that pull request!**

## Coding Standards

- **TypeScript**: All new code must be strictly typed.
- **Components**: Use functional components with React Hooks. Prefer ShadCN UI components for the interface.
- **Firebase**: Use the client-side SDK and follow the established `useCollection` and `useDoc` hook patterns for real-time data.
- **Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS utility classes. Avoid inline styles or custom CSS unless absolutely necessary.
- **Git**: Use descriptive commit messages (e.g., `feat: add lead health gauge`, `fix: resolve hydration error in console`).

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/your-repo/issues)
